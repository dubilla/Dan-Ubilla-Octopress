    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across <a title="Neighborhood Flags" href="http://awesome.good.is/projects/neighborhood-flags/index.html">this project</a> for Good magazine in which a collection of designers and illustrators were called upon to design flags for their respective neighborhoods.
