    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a songwriter, I&rsquo;ve always been amazed at what comes out depending on what&rsquo;s going on in my life.  When things were going well for me, my friend and bandmates would joke that things needed to get worse or the music would suffer.  They were more right than they might have thought.</p>

<p>Matt Skiba on Alkaline Trio&rsquo;s new album, This Addiction:</p>

<blockquote>
Yeah, I was pretty angst-y and heartbroken when I wrote all of those songs. And I think that has a lot to do with the tone of the record because I hadn’t been in that sort of mind frame for a while. I think a lot of people feel angry and heartbroken about whatever it is they might be going through—politics, relationships, friendships, a cat dying—whatever the case may be. And I had some things go on in my life that just brought me back to that very drunk, very angry and sad young man that I was ten years ago. I never went completely off the deep end but I had some dark times and therefore there is some darkness. Not spooky dark, just sad and angry shit.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On October 12, 2004, one of the most anticipated releases of my adolescence hit stores.  I had played the demos out, watched every video, and I waited for my main man John Nolan to step out of the shadow that was Taking Back Sunday and put out his own artistic vision, the self-titled &ldquo;Straylight Run&rdquo;.  I can&rsquo;t claim that the album was all that I had hoped for, but it delivered on plenty of levels.</p>

<p>Even though I was a year out of high school, &ldquo;Existentialism on Prom Night&rdquo; became the anthem for my youth that winter.  My girlfriend of the time refused to sing in front of me, but on the right occasion she would belt out the lyrics, &ldquo;Sing like you think noone&rsquo;s listening&rdquo; as strongly and confidently as I&rsquo;m sure it was meant to be returned.  &ldquo;Thin-lipped gorgeous green eyes smiling&rdquo; became the lyric of hope a few summers later, and &ldquo;a failed attempt to capsulize a feeling&rdquo; was a strong songwriting inspiration.  Two songs off of the six-song demo were considered an A- and B-side, each playing off the other to create a greater sense of how members of Taking Back Sunday split off from the rising, successful band to form this new group that craved an identity and needed a definition.  &ldquo;A Slow Descent&rdquo; did not make the album, and a disappointing version of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the Best&rdquo; did.  Regardless, Straylight Run represented the first step towards a maturity in music that my punk ethos desperately needed.  It was the first step, but I didn&rsquo;t realize these same songs would represent another leap five years later.</p>

    <link href="http://danubilla.com/blog/music/top-ten-albums-of-2008.html"/>
    <updated>2009-04-18T19:53:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://danubilla.com/blog/music/top-ten-albums-of-2008</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the IRS gives us a solid three and a half months to get our financial papers in order, the same amount of time should be granted for a matter much more important: my top ten albums of last year.  As always, each of these albums was originally released in the calendar year.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>10.  City and Colour -Bring Me Your Love</strong>
A whiskey-soaked voice over a minimalist acoustic backdrop has been done before, but Dallas Green&rsquo;s melodies bound and float easily on his second album.  The dynamics of acoustic guitar  really invoke a larger meaning than most coffeehouse emulators can hope for.  Of course the whiskey in the voice matches the solitary motifs in the lyrics.  Here&rsquo;s the soundtrack to your winter, snowy walk.</p>

<p><strong>09.  Tokyo Police Club &ndash; Elephant Shell</strong>
<u>Elephant Shell</u> is confidence creeping up your body.  It is light starting at your knees and energy slowly shooting to your shoulders.  Sparse instrumentation doesn&rsquo;t usually excite, but the drums pick up where melodies leave off and do more than just merely handle the load.  The words behind it all ring catchy with more than enough interwoven subjects between songs to allow for mighty leaps in interpretation.  The strength is in the subtlety.</p>

<p><strong>08.  Jack&rsquo;s Mannequin &ndash; The Glass Passenger</strong>
If Jack&rsquo;s first album <u>Everything in Transit</u> is the summer, then <u>The Glass Passenger</u> is the fall.  If <u>Everything in Transit</u> is blind hope, then <u>The Glass Passenger</u> is optimism laced with nostalgia.  <u>The Glass Passenger</u> runs flush with maturity.  It is a grandiose statement to perseverance through pop.  The power of McMahon&rsquo;s piano is aided through excellent dynamism in the production.  Check out &ldquo;Swim&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hammers and Strings&rdquo; for a sample of the spectrum running through the other eleven tracks.</p>

<p><strong>07.  T.I. &ndash; Paper Trail</strong>
All the talk in the rap world was focused on one man, whose album can be found on countless 2008 Top Ten Lists.  This is not that man, and this is not that album.  While T.I. may have his own legal troubles, <u>Paper Trail</u> was the class act of the rap game last year.  With themes of redemption, innocence and guilt, and atonement, T.I. can shed his reputation of a rapper meant for the club and officially claim the title of a rap artist.  It&rsquo;s not that T.I. didn&rsquo;t sprinkle in his usual radio fodder, but even those tracks are polished smoother and a couple even have a deeper meaning than Clifford J. Harris has used before.  The production is standard, and yet it works.  It shines just enough while giving T.I. ample room to spit his message.  I can&rsquo;t believe it, but here&rsquo;s T.I. on this year&rsquo;s Top 10.</p>

<p><strong>06.  The Hold Steady &ndash; Stay Positive</strong>
The troubadours of allusionary heartache maintain a steady groove with their latest effort, <u>Stay Postive</u>.  Calling the album a sequel to their 2005 record, <u>Boys and Girls in America</u> is much more of a compliment than it might sound.  By throwing in pieces of lyrics from old songs, their new work really does come across as the next stage in an almgamation of unnamed characters the boys have created throughout the years, which gives their base work a much greater sense of cohesion.  The songs pop, and you want to sway along to small town stories of love lost and gained between dusk and dawn.  Despite it all, as the titular songs goes, &ldquo;You gotta stay positive."  Cue the "woah"s.</p>

<p><strong>05.  Coldplay &ndash; Viva la Vida</strong>
Sometime after <u>X&amp;Y</u> came out in 2005, Chris Martin disowned the lyrics he wrote for the album.  He claimed that he rushed the writing process and that it wasn&rsquo;t far to his fans, to his band, and to himself.  Three years later and looking for redemption, Coldplay releases Viva la Vida an epic, swirlingly melodic tour de force.  From the bright, leaping piano in &ldquo;Life in Technicolor&rdquo; to the gang vocal finale in &ldquo;Death and All His Friends&rdquo;, <u>Viva la Vida</u> remains relentless.  The dynamics roll beautifully from song to song, and even the slow tracks sound pulsing and full of live.  And the lyrics&hellip; Chris Martin sounds older, wiser, and in many ways, more vigorous than ever.  By accepting himself, his age, and his maturity, the frontman&rsquo;s delivery is more confident and honest  than it&rsquo;s been since <u>Parachutes</u>.  Growing up has never sounded so good.</p>

<p><strong>04.  Vampire Weekend</strong>
On first listen, this album will make you smile.  By the third run-through, you&rsquo;ll be singing along.  A few more listens, and you&rsquo;ll have the album down pat, but the thing is, you&rsquo;ll never get sick of it.  The beauty of Vampire Weekend&rsquo;s debut, self-titled full-length album is it&rsquo;s ability to remain fresh while quickly becoming familiar.  The record is pop goodness, through and through, and for that and that alone, VW grabs the four spot in this year&rsquo;s Top 10.</p>

<p><strong>03.  Valencia &ndash; We All Need a Reason to Believe</strong>
Valencia doesn&rsquo;t seem to know what the term &ldquo;sophomore slump&rdquo; means.  With their second full-length effort, the Philadelphia band blew their mediocre first record out of the water, embracing drum fills, gang vocals, and &ldquo;woah"s like never before.  Somehow a tired formula feels reinvigorated.  Every song has a hook from the "ho-oh-oh-ohme&rdquo; in &ldquo;Safe to Say&rdquo; to the titular lyric in &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;.  Pop-punk hasn&rsquo;t sounded this good in years.  Call it a revival.  Call it a renaissance.  Call it a fresh start.  Pop-punk is back, and Valencia is waving the flag at the frontline of the battle.</p>

<p><strong>02.  Kanye West &ndash; 808s and Heartbreak</strong>
I&rsquo;ll admit it.  I&rsquo;m a Kanye West apologist, but let&rsquo;s look at this album from two distinct perspectives.  With the first, Mr. West put his name on the line for what is essentially an experimental side-project album in his discography of nearly flawless rap-pop.  The artist decided he wanted to create something heart-bleedingly honest, different, and hopefully through that truth, beauty would emerge.  This is the <u>Kid A</u> of Kanye&rsquo;s collection of work.  Cinematic and large, the album is purposeful but never forced.  &ldquo;Streetlights&rdquo;, a song that has yet to be released as a single, is easily the best song of 2008 from any genre with its simple piano line and simple lyrics of hope, Kanye is able to give the listener a visual like no other.  An introspective, and still brilliant look, from such a public figure is so rare, and for West to be able to humanize himself to such a degree is a feat in and of itself.  What an experiment.  I can&rsquo;t wait for him to return to his regular rap form with his next release.</p>

<p><strong>01.  The Gaslight Anthem &ndash; The &lsquo;59 Sound</strong>
Mad, frantic, and desperate, The Gaslight Anthem&rsquo;s <u>The '59 Sound</u> is the new pop-punk.  If you grew up listening to Blink 182 and New Found Glory, this is your graduation.  Reeking of reflection and waning innocence, this album was surely written after many nights of emptying bottles on front porches with old friends.  Despite the demure this description might imply, the whole album makes you want to run downtown soaking up every last bit of life possible before last call sends you on your next adventure.  The guitar tones ring, the drums pound, and the punk ethos stays true.  Pick up this album and feel alive.</p>
